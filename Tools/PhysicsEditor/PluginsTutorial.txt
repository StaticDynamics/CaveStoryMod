=== How to Write Plugins for the Physics Editor ===
================= By Carrotlord ===================

Plugins are a way for users to extend the functionality of the Cave Story
Physics Editor. Normally you can only edit player agility and a handful of
weapons, but you can also write plugins that let you edit many more things.

Plugins consist of two parts: code and settings. The code reads data from the
settings, which are values inputted by the plugin's user, and then modifies the
executable according to those settings.

These plugins are written in Mint, a programming language I designed that runs
on a Java interpreter.

Now let's write some code:

*** Plugin 1: Behemoth Speed Change ***
setText("BehemothLeftSpeed=-256")
waitForUserInput()
import type
speed = int(readKeyValue("BehemothLeftSpeed"))
hex = littleEndian(speed)
gName = getGameName()
import file
writeHex(gName, hex, 159032)
display("Speed written to exe.")

To use a plugin, hit the plugins button on the upper menu bar and click on
"Add a Plugin". Also you can use the keyboard shortcuts if you wish.
Switch to the newly created tab.

Next, paste in the Mint code for the plugin.
Then, click on the "Execute Plugin Code" button in the plugins menu.
Now edit the settings that appear in the textbox.
Finally, click on "Apply Plugin to Executable" in the plugins menu.

If you change the behemoth's leftward speed to something like -2000, you will
see that the behemoth now moves much faster in the left direction. Good.

The waitForUserInput() function will wait until the user finishes editing the
settings before performing more code.

readKeyValue(key) will read the value from key=value in the settings.

littleEndian(integer) will change an integer into 4 bytes of hexadecimal
data.

Let's attempt something slightly more complicated.

*** Plugin 2: Speed Up with Flags ***
setText("SpeedChange=Add 800 to player's speed if flag 200 is set.")
waitForUserInput()
change = readKeyValue("SpeedChange")
lst = change.split(" ")
import type
speedUp = littleEndian(int(lst[1]))
flag = littleEndian(int(lst[7]))
gName = getGameName()
import file
writeHex(gName, "E9D0E007009090", 87839)
code = "6800410000E832B1F7FF83C40483F801"
code += "7513C745EC2C0300008145ECF4010000"
code += "E90D1FF8FFC745EC2C030000EBF2"
writeHex(gName, code, 604148)
writeHex(gName, speedUp, 604176)
writeHex(gName, flag, 604149)

Change the two numbers in the sentence and you will add some number to
the player's max horizontal speed when a certain flag is set.
To disable the feature, use 0 as the speed.

it as a standalone coding platform, please download Mint 1.3 from:
